## WEEK 2 QUIZ
### 1. Question 1
# Suppose I define the following function in R
cube <- function(x, n) {
        x^3
}
#What is the result of running
cube(3)
#in R after defining this function?
#Answer: The number 27 is returned

### 2. Question 2
The following code will produce a warning in R.
x <- 1:10
if(x > 5) {
        x <- 0
}
# Why? 
#Answer:'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement.
